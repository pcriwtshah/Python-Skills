CTRL0 RETURNS TO NORMAL)\n\n<b>Python</b> is a high level programming language that is used for everything from robotics to web engines to ecommerce to games.  One of the keys to Python's success is that it is built on a simple, unifying philosphy -- namely, that \"everything is an object.\"   Objects in computer-related contexts is much like objects in all contexts -- they are things that have properties (name, shape, position, color, temperature) and that also have methods for modifying, utilizing, or communicating those properties ( e.g., methods for changing the object's color, or moving the object to a new position, or telling its name to another object, etcetera).   \n\nMore specifically, Python is based on a philosophy of usability, readability, and minimal impediments to the true goal of all programming -- i.e., solving problems via the implementation of algorithms.  Python itself can perhaps explain this much more eloquently.  \n\nIf you place your cursor after the word 'this' in the cell after <b>In [ ]:</b>,  \n\n<img src=\"http://math.etsu.edu/knisleyj/images/ImportThis.png\" alt = \"Place Cursor at the end of In [ ] :   import this\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\"/>\n\nand then press the enter key while holding down the shift key<b> ( we call this <b> [shift]-[enter] </b> ), then Python itself (actually, Tim Peters) will tell you what it is all about.  \n\n\n\n\n"

Thus, we will motivate our initial foray into programming with Python via a problem to be solved.\n\nIn particular, the problem we will consider is motivated by the study of DNA, which in many contexts is modeled as alphabetic strings made up of the letters A, T, G, and C.  For example, \"AGTCGAATCGACATC\" is a short DNA segment.  Moreover, certain sub-patterns in DNA are especially important.  For example, genes tend to start near CG islands ( = regions where there are lots of CG pairs ), and genes often end with strings of repeated A\u2019s.
