It is a \"pure\" abstract math topic, but can be applied to real-world situations where there is error and uncertainty.\n","\n","The main reason we need statistics is because it is generally not possible to collect *all* the data ever for a problem. Doing that is called a census (what the US tries to do every 10 years), and is generally expensive and unrealistic (especially if data changes over time). Instead for most problems we have data about a subset of it - a *sample* - and then we use statistics to say things about the broader *population* (all data) that it represents.\n","\n","There are two types of methods in statistics - *descriptive* and *inferential*. Descriptive means summarizing data, often with measures such as the mean, median, and mode. Inferential means identifying patterns in your sample data and making predictions about the broader population.\n","\n","For today we'll be starting with descriptive statistics - inference is clearly cool, but a lot of good work can be done by starting simple and only making things more complicated as necessary."]},{"metadata":{"id":"vHOQ5ok2k6rn","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Random Variables\n","\n","In most math, a variable is a symbol to specify an arbitrary, but still in some sense unchanging and unique, value.
