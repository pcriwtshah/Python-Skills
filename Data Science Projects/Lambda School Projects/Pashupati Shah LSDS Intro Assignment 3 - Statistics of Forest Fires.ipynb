In this assignment you'll look at a data set of forest fires in Portugal during 2007 - this is a real research dataset, and you can [read more about it](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires) though you do not need to for this assignment.\n","\n","For our purposes, the main thing that you need to understand are the attributes in the data.\n","\n","1. X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9\n","2. Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9\n","3. month - month of the year: 'jan' to 'dec'\n","4. day - day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun'\n","5. FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20\n","6. DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3\n","7. DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6\n","8. ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10\n","9. temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30\n","10. RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100\n","11. wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40\n","12. rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4\n","13. area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84 \n","\n","Most of these features are numeric - this means we can do things like look at their mean, median, mode, and plot histograms. They have technical sounding names, but generally refer to meteorological data (i.e. the weather).\n","\n","For the discrete features we can still draw histograms (as in the lecture notebook). X and Y are already integer values - month and day do have natural order, but if you want to use them you may want to translate them from strings to numbers (hint - you can build a dict that maps them, and loop over to apply it)."]},{"metadata":{"id":"2hdt1i4H6gQ2","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Exercise 1 -
